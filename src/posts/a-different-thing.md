Since the first U.S. case of the coronavirus was identified in Washington state on Jan. 21, health officials have identified thousands of cases across the United States. By March 17, the virus had expanded its presence from several isolated clusters in Washington, New York and California to all 50 states and the [District of Columbia](). To date, there have been over 120 deaths across the country.

Social distancing is widely seen as the best available means to "flatten the curve of the pandemic," a phrase that epidemiologists use to describe slowing the spread of infection. This approach can save lives by keeping local health care systems from being overwhelmed.

In response to mounting cases, states have begun closing schools, banning large gatherings and urging people to stay home when possible. On Monday, President Trump announced [new guidelines]() recommending that Americans avoid gathering in groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel and going out to eat.

To avoid spreading the disease, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends basic precautions such as hand-washing and cleaning frequently touched surfaces every day.

Globally, the respiratory disease has spread to dozens of countries and has killed several thousand people since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December.

Warnings issued by the CDC recommend avoiding nonessential travel to dozens of countries with outbreaks of COVID-19, including China, Iran, South Korea and much of Europe. The U.S. government has banned travel from Europe, although the ban makes exceptions, including for U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.
